### 1775

Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those, who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.
 
  I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. Let us not, I beseech you, sir, decieve ourselves longer. Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned, we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded ; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free  if we mean to rpreserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contendingif we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged oursels never to abandon, until the glorious ojbect of our contest shall be obtainedwemust fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of Hosts is all that is left us!
  
  They tell us, sir, that we are weak--unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be strong? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supiely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and font?
  
  Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those menas which the God of nature has placed in our power. Three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we posses, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battels alone. There is a just God who presides over the destines of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alonge; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.
  
  It is vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen man cry "Peace, peace" -- But there is no peace. The war is actually begun! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? IS life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbig it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!
